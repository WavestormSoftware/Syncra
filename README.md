# Syncra

Syncra is a Project Tracker/Todo list designed for use by developers within the Wavestorm Team. While it's in the early stages of development, we have a vision for its evolution. Please be aware that Syncra is tailored specifically for our team members, and as such, we may not incorporate external suggestions or contributions.

## Platform Support

As of now, Syncra is built for Windows using Winforms. There's no immediate need for other platform support. However, once our UI framework, 'Twilight,' is complete (currently in development for our game engines), we plan to leverage it to make Syncra accessible on various platforms, including Windows, MacOS, Linux, and potentially Android & iOS.

## Contribution Guidelines

While we appreciate your interest and enthusiasm, please understand that Syncra's primary focus is internal use within the Wavestorm Team. Consequently, we may not incorporate external suggestions or contributions at this time.

Thank you for your understanding and support!

Sincerely,
[The Wavestorm Team](https://wavestorm.net)
